Oliver Steele is a DPhil candidate at the University of Sussex under the supervision of Dr Andrew Penn and Dr Ruth Murrell-Lagnado. Currently investigating the impact of APOE polymorphism on NMDA receptor mediated synaptic transmission, Oli also teaches on a range of undergraduate and masters level degree programmes on a range of topics including basic neuroscience, neurophysiology and statistics.

Previous research experience has seen Oli work on the use of stem cells in disease repair in a model of Huntington's Disease (with the European Consortium, Repair HD) and in disease modelling in a rare childhood epilepsy condition, as well as investigating glucose concentration manipulation in the hippocampus.
